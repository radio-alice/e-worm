## Production mode and deployment

To start a production version of your app, run `npm run build && npm start`. This will disable live reloading, and activate the appropriate bundler plugins.

You can deploy your application to any environment that supports Node 8 or above. As an example, to deploy to [Now](https://zeit.co/now), run these commands:

```bash
npm install -g now
now
```
